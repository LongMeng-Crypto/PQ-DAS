## 1. Motivation

- **Data availability sampling (DAS):** DAS lets light clients gain confidence that block or blob data is available without downloading the full payload. A validator samples a few authenticated positions; if enough validators accept, the network treats the data as available.

- **Why availability is not just storage:** In a DA system, the useful guarantee is that honest parties can later recover the underlying data, not merely that a commitment was posted. A construction is more useful when sampled openings can become recovery material for the original payload.

- **Post-quantum motivation:** Many deployed or proposed DAS systems rely on polynomial commitments such as KZG, which are not post-quantum. PQ-DAS asks whether we can build DAS from hash-based commitments and transparent proof systems while keeping practical prover and verifier costs.

- **Engineering target:** The goal of this project is a repairable, hash-based, LeanVM-proved DAS construction with realistic blob sizes and measurable end-to-end performance.

## 2. Solution Space

- **Commitments for Arbitrary Codes:** The builder encodes the data with an arbitrary erasure code, commits to the encoded word, and proves that the committed word is a valid codeword. Validators sample authenticated codeword positions, and any sufficiently large set of accepted positions can be fed to the erasure decoder. This is the most flexible route for repairability because the opened samples are directly usable as decoding input.

- **Commitments for Tensor Codes:** The data is arranged in a multidimensional tensor-code layout, and the commitment/proof checks consistency along tensor dimensions. Validators sample local views whose consistency implies global availability under the tensor-code structure. This can give efficient soundness from product-code structure, but the recovery interface is tied to the tensor layout rather than a generic set of authenticated RS cells.

- **Commitments for Interleaved Codes:** Multiple codewords are interleaved so that one sampled position opens aligned symbols from many rows. The construction amortizes commitment and sampling costs across a batch of codewords. It is attractive for batching, but its commitment structure is optimized for interleaved sampling rather than the simple “collect verified cells and decode” interface we want.

- **FRIDA:** FRIDA follows a transparent, FRI-style direction: encode the data, commit with hash-based structures, and use proximity/low-degree testing to support DAS without pairings. Validators check sampled openings together with transparent proof material. Its main advantage is post-quantum transparency, while its workflow is centered on proximity testing rather than making every accepted sample a direct repair cell.

- **ZODA:** ZODA is another post-quantum DAS direction based on hash-based commitments and transparent proofs. At a high level, the builder commits to encoded data and provides proof material that sampled openings are consistent with an available codeword. It is an important PQ reference point, but this project focuses on a repairable Encode + Prove construction implemented inside LeanVM.

## 3. Chosen Direction: Repairable Encode + Prove

- **Repairability:** Repairability means that once the network has collected enough authenticated openings, those openings can be used to reconstruct the original data. This is stronger than merely accepting an availability statement: it gives the network a concrete recovery path if the original builder or storage providers disappear.

- **Why repairability matters:** In practical DA use cases, validators and users may need to recover data after the block has already been accepted. A DAS construction that only proves proximity or consistency is less useful if its sampled openings are not naturally organized as repair material.

- **Why arbitrary-code Encode + Prove is the right fit:** In Commitments for Arbitrary Codes, the proof binds the committed object to a valid erasure-codeword, and each opened cell is authenticated against that same committed codeword. Therefore accepted cells are exactly the objects needed by the erasure decoder. Tensor, interleaved, and proximity-oriented designs can be efficient for sampling, but they do not expose the same generic repair interface as directly.

- **Post-quantum construction principle:** If the commitment is hash-based and the validity proof is produced by a transparent hash/symmetric-based proof system, then the construction avoids algebraic pairings and discrete-log assumptions. This gives a path to PQ-DAS while preserving repairability.

- **Blob and encoding layout:** Each blob row is represented as extension-field symbols and encoded as a Reed-Solomon codeword. The main measured profile uses $k=16384$ payload symbols per row, $m=32768$ encoded symbols per row, and RS rate $1/2$.

- **Cell digest matrix:** Each encoded row is split into $\ell=1024$ cells, with $c=32$ extension-field symbols per cell. The proof hashes every cell into a cell digest, so both row commitments and column commitments are derived from the same digest matrix.

- **Systematic row commitment:** For each row, the systematic cell digests are hashed into a row digest. The row digests are then Merkle-aggregated into a row root. This binds the systematic payload-facing view of every row.

- **Column commitment:** For every cell column, the proof builds an inner Merkle tree over the cell digests from all rows and obtains one column root. All column roots are then Merkle-aggregated into a column root. This is the object used for column sampling and opening verification.

- **Final commitment:** The public commitment is a hash of the row root and column root. Thus the public root binds both the systematic row view and the column-sampling view of the same cell digest matrix.

- **LeanVM proof relation:** The private witness is the encoded codeword matrix. The LeanVM proof checks cell digest computation, systematic row commitment, row-root aggregation, inner and outer column Merkle commitments, final-root binding, and one Reed-Solomon membership check per row.

- **RS membership check:** Fiat-Shamir derives the public check vector $L$ outside the proof from the public parameters and root. The verifier independently recomputes the same $L$, while the proof only checks the inner products $\langle w_i,L\rangle=0$ inside LeanVM.

- **Opening and verification:** A verifier samples cell columns. The builder opens the corresponding codeword cells and Merkle authentication data, and the verifier recomputes cell digests, column roots, and the final public root.

- **Reconstruction:** Once enough distinct cell columns are available, reconstruction uses FFT-based Reed-Solomon erasure decoding for arbitrary cell-erasure patterns. The decoder reconstructs the full row polynomial and then extracts the systematic payload.

| Extension field $\mathbb{E}$ | Quintic extension field used for payload symbols, RS evaluations, Fiat-Shamir challenge points, and RS membership inner products. |
| $n$ | Number of blob rows in one proved matrix. |
| $k$ | Number of payload symbols per row before rate-$1/2$ encoding. |
| $m$ | Number of encoded symbols per row. In the measured profile, $m=2k$. |
| $\rho$ | RS code rate $k/m$. |

## 5. Benchmark Metrics

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Commitment size | Public commitment size. |
| Proof size | Serialized LeanVM proof size reported by the benchmark harness. |
| Sample size | Total sampled opening size for the chosen $\lvert Q\rvert$ columns. |
| Encode + commit | Host time to encode rows, compute cell digests, and build commitments. |
| Prover preprocess | Time to rebuild verifier-visible public statement data, including Fiat-Shamir and $L$. |
| LeanVM prove | Time to generate the LeanVM proof. |
| Opening generation | Time to produce sampled openings. |
| Verifier rebuild | Time for the verifier to reconstruct the public statement and $L$. |
| LeanVM verify | Time to verify the LeanVM proof. |
| Verify openings | Time to verify sampled column openings. |
| Reconstruct | Time to reconstruct the payload from accepted cells. |
| VM cycles | LeanVM guest cycles. |
| Poseidon16 calls | Number of Poseidon width-16 calls used by the proof relation. |
| ExtensionOp calls | Number of extension-field operation calls used by RS membership. |
| LeanVM proving throughput | Effective payload divided by LeanVM proving time. |
| Full DAS throughput | Effective payload divided by the full builder-to-validator workflow time. |

The full DAS throughput is computed as

$$
\frac{D_{\mathrm{payload}}}{T_{\mathrm{encode+commit}}+T_{\mathrm{preprocess}}+T_{\mathrm{prove}}+T_{\mathrm{open}}+T_{\mathrm{verifier\ rebuild}}+T_{\mathrm{verify\ proof}}+T_{\mathrm{verify\ openings}}+T_{\mathrm{upload}}+T_{\mathrm{download}}}.
$$

Here $D_{\mathrm{payload}}$ is the useful blob payload size, i.e. number of blobs times blob size with the extension-field bit-size correction. The upload and download times are computed from the uploaded/downloaded byte sizes and the assumed $50$ Mbps bandwidth. Reconstruction is reported separately because it is not on the critical path for validator acceptance.

- WHIR log inverse rate $r$ means the WHIR proof-system RS rate is $2^{-r}$, so $r=1$ is rate $1/2$ and $r=2$ is rate $1/4$.
- Rates $r=3,4$ correspond to WHIR rates $1/8$ and $1/16$, but the target extension-field profiles panic in WHIR config construction with `Increase folding_factor_0` under LeanVM's default `WHIR_INITIAL_FOLDING_FACTOR=7`. Supporting them would require changing the global WHIR initial folding factor and synchronizing verifier/recursion configuration, so they are not included as a one-variable benchmark sweep.

## 14. Summary

- **Main outcome:** A repairable post-quantum Encode + Prove DAS construction can be implemented with hash-based commitments and LeanVM proofs at roughly $0.9$ MiB/s across the strongest measured repairable profiles, with single-profile runs occasionally reaching about $1$ MiB/s.

- **Most important design choice:** The construction keeps sampled cells useful for reconstruction. This is the practical advantage of the arbitrary-code Encode + Prove route over approaches optimized only for sampling or proximity testing.

- **Parameter lessons:** Cell size $c=32$ is the strongest current point for the 2x profile, $c=32$ and $c=64$ are both competitive for the 4x profile, and row counts around $n=12$ to $n=14$ avoid the large proving-time cliffs seen at exact larger powers of two.

- **Main bottleneck:** The proof relation is still dominated by Poseidon calls for cell/row/column commitments and extension-field operations for RS membership. Reducing these costs inside LeanVM is the clearest path toward higher throughput.
